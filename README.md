# CalculatorApp
A simple C# console calculator with **unit tests**.  
The program allows a user to enter two numbers and calculates:

- âœ… Sum of the numbers  
- âœ… Product of the numbers  
- âœ… Quotient of the numbers (with division-by-zero handling)  
- âœ… Difference of the numbers  

Unit tests are written with **MSTest** to verify correctness.
